# Protection-relay

This code is an efficient sandbox for experimenting with how defensive relays react to various short-circuit situations on a three-phase power system. By allowing the user to select from single-line-to-ground, line-to-line, double-line-to-ground, or three-phase faults—and by defining when the fault occurs, for how long it persists, and how intense it is—the program can simulate nearly any traditional fault situation. It then "measures" the ensuing currents with increased noise, takes their phasors each sample with a one-cycle discrete Fourier transform, and inputs them to a definite-time over-current relay model. The relay's pick-up level is established as a multiple of the pre-fault current, and a short intentional delay provides against momentary transients giving rise to a nuisance trip.

Since all—fault injection, phasor estimation, protection logic, and power calculation—reside in a single file, engineers or students can immediately visualize the whole chain from raw waveforms to relay decision. The plots indicate fault inception and relay trip, which makes it straightforward to check coordination (e.g., after how long a fault the relay trips) or to test various pickup factors and delays. The power-loss calculation for faults, which is optional, displays the economic effect of each fault, and the modular helper functions can be easily replaced with more advanced algorithms (such as differential protection or adaptive thresholds) without altering the test harness. Overall, this script is a hands-on teaching and prototyping environment for relay protection and fault analysis for distribution or transmission studies.
